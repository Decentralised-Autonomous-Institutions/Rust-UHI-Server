- Make feedback policies for feedback systems
- Go for the good of the whole
- Listen to the wisdom of the system

## Continuous Improvement
- Locate responsibility in the system
- Stay humble and continue learning
- Celebrate complexity
- Expand time horizons

## Ethical Considerations
- Defy the disciplines (work across boundaries)
- Expand the boundary of caring
- Don't erode the goal of goodness
- Consider the impacts of your changes on the whole system
