# Project Context and Architecture
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a powerful agentic AI coding assistant for this Rust project, following the official Rust API Guidelines.
  
  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/architecture.mermaid: System architecture and component relationships
  - docs/technical.md: Technical specifications and patterns
  - docs/tasks.md: Current development tasks and requirements
  - docs/status.md: Project progress and state
  - Cargo.toml: Project dependencies and metadata
  
  Before making any changes:
  1. Parse and understand system architecture from docs/architecture.mermaid
  2. Check current task context from docs/tasks.md
  3. Update progress in docs/status.md
  4. Follow technical specifications from docs/technical.md
  5. Verify crate organization and dependencies in Cargo.toml
  
  As an agentic assistant, you should:
  1. Actively pair program with developers to solve coding tasks
  2. Provide direct code edits when appropriate rather than just suggestions
  3. Analyze contextual information (open files, cursor position, edit history, linter errors)
  4. Run terminal commands when needed to diagnose or solve problems
  5. Search the codebase to find relevant information for the current task

# File Management Rules
ON_FILE_CHANGE: |
  Required actions after any code changes:
  1. READ docs/architecture.mermaid to verify architectural compliance
  2. UPDATE docs/status.md with:
     - Current progress
     - Any new issues encountered
     - Completed items
  3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
  4. VERIFY task progress against docs/tasks.md
  5. RUN cargo clippy to ensure code quality
  6. RUN cargo fmt to maintain consistent formatting
  
  When making code changes, follow these principles:
  1. Group together edits to the same file in a single change
  2. Ensure generated code can run immediately without modification
  3. Create appropriate dependency management files when starting new components
  4. Read the existing contents or section before editing
  5. Fix linter errors when clear how to do so, but don't make uneducated guesses

# Code Style and Patterns
RUST_GUIDELINES: |
  - Package Organization:
    - Use consistent crate naming (snake_case)
    - Ensure README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, and examples exist
    - Minimize dependencies and use semantic versioning
    - Create appropriate setup files for new projects

  - Documentation:
    - Document all public items with rustdoc
    - Include examples in documentation
    - Use crate-level documentation to explain overall purpose
    - Link to external documentation for complex concepts

  - Naming Conventions:
    - Use snake_case for variables, functions, modules, and crates
    - Use UpperCamelCase for types, traits, and enum variants
    - Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants and statics
    - Use verbs for methods that modify self, nouns for methods that don't

  - API Design:
    - Make APIs type-safe and minimize escape hatches
    - Use iterators instead of collections when possible
    - Make constructors simple and obvious
    - Implement standard traits (Debug, Clone, etc.) when appropriate
    - Use builders for complex object construction

  - Error Handling:
    - Define custom error types for domain-specific errors
    - Implement std::error::Error for error types
    - Use Result<T, E> for functions that can fail
    - Preserve underlying error context when transforming errors
    - Panic only for unrecoverable programming errors

  - Performance:
    - Prefer owned types over references where appropriate
    - Use &[T] and &str over Vec<T> and String for read-only access
    - Avoid unnecessary allocations
    - Provide `_in_place` variants for operations that modify data

  - Flexibility:
    - Use generics and traits to provide flexibility
    - Implement From/Into, TryFrom/TryInto for type conversions
    - Use AsRef/AsMut for lightweight conversions
    - Consider marker traits for important properties

  - Safety:
    - Mark unsafe code blocks as minimal as possible
    - Document all safety invariants for unsafe code
    - Use safe abstractions over unsafe code whenever possible
    - Validate all inputs in unsafe code

# Architecture Understanding
READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
  File: docs/architecture.mermaid
  Required parsing:
  1. Load and parse complete Mermaid diagram
  2. Extract and understand:
     - Module boundaries and relationships
     - Data flow patterns
     - System interfaces
     - Component dependencies
  3. Validate any changes against architectural constraints
  4. Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns
  
  Codebase searching guidance:
  1. Use semantic search for finding relevant code snippets rather than grep/file search when possible
  2. When reading files, read larger sections at once rather than many small calls
  3. Stop searching once you've found a reasonable place to edit or answer
  
  Error handling:
  1. If file not found: STOP and notify user
  2. If diagram parse fails: REQUEST clarification
  3. If architectural violation detected: WARN user

# Task Management
TASK_WORKFLOW: |
  Required files:
  - docs/tasks.md: Source of task definitions
  - docs/status.md: Progress tracking
  - docs/technical.md: Implementation guidelines
  - Cargo.toml: Project configuration
  
  Workflow steps:
  1. READ docs/tasks.md:
     - Parse current task requirements
     - Extract acceptance criteria
     - Identify dependencies
  
  2. VALIDATE against docs/architecture.mermaid:
     - Confirm architectural alignment
     - Check component interactions
  
  3. UPDATE docs/status.md:
     - Mark task as in-progress
     - Track completion of sub-tasks
     - Document any blockers
  
  4. IMPLEMENT following TDD:
     - Create test modules first
     - Implement to pass tests
     - Ensure 100% test coverage for public API
     - Update status on test completion
  
  For coding tasks:
  1. Understand the current state by examining relevant files
  2. Make targeted edits to implement the required functionality
  3. Run terminal commands to test and validate changes
  4. Provide clear explanations of changes made and reasoning

# Error Prevention
VALIDATION_RULES: |
  1. Verify type safety:
     - Check for proper error handling with Result
     - Avoid unwrap() and expect() in production code
     - Use Option<T> for values that may not exist
  
  2. Memory safety:
     - Verify lifetimes are properly specified
     - Check for potential memory leaks
     - Ensure proper use of reference counting (Rc/Arc)
     - Validate mutable references don't cause data races

  3. API Consistency:
     - Ensure consistent naming patterns
     - Verify proper trait implementations
     - Check documentation completeness
     - Validate public API against guidelines

  4. Performance considerations:
     - Check for unnecessary clones or allocations
     - Verify proper use of borrowing
     - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
     - Consider benchmarking critical paths
