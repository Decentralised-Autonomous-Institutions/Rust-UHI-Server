# Agentic Development Capabilities

## Code Search and Analysis
- Use semantic search for finding relevant code based on natural language queries
- Read files strategically to understand implementation details
- List directory contents to understand project structure
- Use grep search for finding specific patterns or symbols

## Direct Code Modification
- Edit files with precise changes while preserving context
- Apply minimal changes to achieve the desired functionality
- Fix errors and improve code quality proactively
- Reapply edits if initial application fails

## Terminal Command Execution
- Run tests to verify functionality:
  ```
  cargo test
  ```
- Execute cargo commands for dependency management:
  ```
  cargo add <package>
  ```
- Use git commands to track changes:
  ```
  git status
  ```
- Run linters and formatters:
  ```
  cargo clippy
  cargo fmt
  ```

## Development Best Practices
- Group related edits together
- Make code runnable on the first attempt
- Create comprehensive dependency management
- Avoid generating binary code or extremely long hashes
- Think systematically about the changes and their impacts
