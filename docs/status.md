# UHI Project Status

## Project Overview
The Unified Health Interface (UHI) project aims to create an open protocol for digital health services, enabling seamless interactions between patients and healthcare service providers. The project consists of several components:

1. **UHI Gateway Server** - Core implementation of the UHI Protocol
2. **End User Application (EUA)** - Front-end interfaces for patients
3. **Health Service Provider Application (HSPA)** - Interfaces for healthcare providers
4. **Connectors** - Integration with existing healthcare systems
5. **Blockchain Certification Layer** - For secure and verifiable health records

## Current Phase Details

### Phase 1: Core UHI Gateway Server (Current)

We're currently implementing the core UHI Gateway Server with the following status:

- **Core Framework**: Implemented architectural design using Actix-web, setting up project structure, and implementing base components.
- **HTTP Layer**: Implemented route definitions and basic middleware setup.
- **Handler Layer**: Basic handlers are in place, updating to use service dependency injection.
- **Service Layer**: Service interfaces defined and implementing dependency injection pattern. Implementation progress varies by service:
  - **FulfillmentService**: Well-implemented (80%) with comprehensive availability checking, time slot validation, and state management.
  - **ProviderService**: Good implementation progress (60%) with provider management, availability checking, and specialty-based search.
  - **SearchService**: Enhanced implementation (60%) with basic search functionality, search request validation, transaction tracking, and provider identification.
  - **CatalogService**: Early implementation stage (10%) with basic catalog management.
  - **OrderService**: Early implementation stage (10%) with basic order creation.
  - **NetworkRegistryService**: Partial implementation (30%) with basic registry operations.
- **Storage Layer**: Defined traits, implemented in-memory storage for testing and development.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling system.
- **Configuration**: Implemented configuration module with environment-based settings.
- **Data Models**: Implemented all required data models based on the UHI Protocol specification.
- **Dependency Flow**: Implementing pattern where storage is injected into services, and services are injected into handlers.

**Progress**: 55% complete

## Architectural Updates

We've updated our architectural approach to use a cleaner dependency injection pattern:

1. **Service Layer as Intermediary**: The service layer now acts as the intermediary between handlers and storage, with services receiving storage instances via constructor injection.

2. **Dependency Injection Flow**:
   - Storage instances are created and Arc-wrapped in main.rs
   - Services receive storage in their constructors
   - Handlers receive services via Actix's web::Data

3. **Removed Direct Storage Access**: Handlers no longer directly access storage but work only through the service layer, improving separation of concerns.

4. **Application Initialization**: The main.rs file now initializes the entire dependency chain, creating storage, injecting it into services, and registering services with the Actix app.

5. **Service Interaction**: Services interact with each other to fulfill complex business requirements, with clear boundaries of responsibility.

## Technical Debt/Issues

1. **Schema Definition**: The database schema needs to be properly defined and migrations created.
2. **Authentication**: Need to implement proper signature verification for the X-Gateway-Authorization header.
3. **Error Handling**: Need to ensure consistent error response format across all endpoints.
4. **Logging**: Enhanced structured logging for improved observability.
5. **Mock Data**: Need to implement mock data for the in-memory storage for testing purposes.
6. **Service Implementation**: Need to complete service implementations with the new dependency injection pattern.
7. **Handler Updates**: Need to update all handlers to use services instead of direct storage access.
8. **Service Integration**: Need to integrate services with each other for end-to-end flows.

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining service layer implementations:
   - Finish SearchService implementation
   - Complete CatalogService implementation
   - Develop OrderService functionality
   - Enhance NetworkRegistryService
2. Update all handlers to use the service layer
3. Implement service interactions for end-to-end flows
4. Implement database schema and PostgreSQL storage
5. Implement authentication middleware
6. Add unit tests for all services
7. Set up CI/CD pipelines
8. Implement integration tests for end-to-end flows
9. Update API documentation with OpenAPI specification
10. Prepare for Phase 2: EUA and HSPA development
