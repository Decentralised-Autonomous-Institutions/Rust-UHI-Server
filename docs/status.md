We're currently implementing the core UHI Gateway Server with the following status:

- **Core Framework**: Implemented architectural design using Actix-web, setting up project structure, and implementing base components.
- **HTTP Layer**: Implemented route definitions and basic middleware setup.
- **Handler Layer**: Basic handlers are in place, updating to use service dependency injection.
- **Service Layer**: Service interfaces defined and implementing dependency injection pattern. Implementation progress varies by service:
  - **FulfillmentService**: Well-implemented (85%) with comprehensive availability checking, time slot validation, state management, and state transition validation.
  - **ProviderService**: Well-implemented (90%) with provider management, availability checking (including working hours and breaks), specialty-based search, and location-based search.
  - **SearchService**: Enhanced implementation (60%) with basic search functionality, search request validation, transaction tracking, and provider identification.
  - **CatalogService**: Enhanced implementation (80%) with catalog management, validation, selection handling, quotation generation, and availability checking.
  - **OrderService**: Implementation progressing (30%) with order creation, basic order management, and integration with FulfillmentService for status checking.
  - **NetworkRegistryService**: Partial implementation (30%) with basic registry operations.
- **Storage Layer**: Defined traits, implemented in-memory storage for testing and development.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling system.
- **Configuration**: Implemented configuration module with environment-based settings.
- **Data Models**: Implemented all required data models based on the UHI Protocol specification.
- **Dependency Flow**: Implementing pattern where storage is injected into services, and services are injected into handlers.

**Progress**: 60% complete

## Architectural Updates

We've updated our architectural approach to use a cleaner dependency injection pattern:

1. **Service Layer as Intermediary**: The service layer now acts as the intermediary between handlers and storage, with services receiving storage instances via constructor injection.

2. **Dependency Injection Flow**:
   - Storage instances are created and Arc-wrapped in main.rs
   - Services receive storage in their constructors
   - Handlers receive services via Actix's web::Data

3. **Removed Direct Storage Access**: Handlers no longer directly access storage but work only through the service layer, improving separation of concerns.

4. **Application Initialization**: The main.rs file now initializes the entire dependency chain, creating storage, injecting it into services, and registering services with the Actix app.

5. **Service Interaction**: Services interact with each other to fulfill complex business requirements, with clear boundaries of responsibility.

## Technical Debt/Issues

1. **Schema Definition**: The database schema needs to be properly defined and migrations created.
2. **Authentication**: Need to implement proper signature verification for the X-Gateway-Authorization header.
3. **Error Handling**: Need to ensure consistent error response format across all endpoints.
4. **Logging**: Enhanced structured logging for improved observability.
5. **Mock Data**: Need to implement mock data for the in-memory storage for testing purposes.
6. **Service Implementation**: Need to complete service implementations with the new dependency injection pattern.
7. **Handler Updates**: Need to update all handlers to use services instead of direct storage access.
8. **Service Integration**: Need to integrate services with each other for end-to-end flows.

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining service layer implementations:
   - Finish SearchService implementation
   - Complete CatalogService implementation
   - Develop OrderService functionality
   - Enhance NetworkRegistryService
2. Update all handlers to use the service layer
3. Implement service interactions for end-to-end flows
4. Implement database schema and PostgreSQL storage
5. Implement authentication middleware
6. Add unit tests for all services
7. Set up CI/CD pipelines
8. Implement integration tests for end-to-end flows
9. Update API documentation with OpenAPI specification
10. Prepare for Phase 2: EUA and HSPA development

## Recent Implementation Highlights

1. **Status Checking Flow Implementation**: 
   - Implemented bidirectional synchronization between OrderService and FulfillmentService
   - Added state validation in FulfillmentService with a proper state machine
   - Updated status handlers to use the service layer
   - Implemented automatic state mapping between order states and fulfillment states
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the status flow

2. **Service Integration Improvements**:
   - OrderService now depends on FulfillmentService for status checking
   - FulfillmentService maintains state consistency with OrderService
   - Status updates propagate bidirectionally between orders and fulfillments
   - Service interfaces follow consistent patterns and error handling

3. **Handler Layer Updates**:
   - Status handlers now use OrderService for processing
   - Handlers properly propagate errors to HTTP responses
   - Clear separation of concerns with handlers only interacting with services
