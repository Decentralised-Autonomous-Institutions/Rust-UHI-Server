# UHI Project Status

## Project Overview
The Universal Health Interface (UHI) project aims to create an open protocol for digital health services, enabling seamless interactions between patients and healthcare service providers. The project consists of several components:

1. **UHI Gateway Server** - Core implementation of the UHI Protocol
2. **End User Application (EUA)** - Front-end interfaces for patients
3. **Health Service Provider Application (HSPA)** - Interfaces for healthcare providers
4. **Connectors** - Integration with existing healthcare systems
5. **Blockchain Certification Layer** - For secure and verifiable health records

## Implementation Status

## Current Phase Details

### Phase 1: Core UHI Gateway Server (Current)

We're currently implementing the core UHI Gateway Server with the following status:

- **Core Framework**: Implemented architectural design using Actix-web, setting up project structure, and implementing base components.
- **HTTP Layer**: Implemented route definitions and basic middleware setup.
- **Handler Layer**: Basic placeholder handlers are in place, actual functionality implementation in progress.
- **Service Layer**: Basic service interfaces are defined, implementations need to be completed.
- **Storage Layer**: Defined traits, PostgreSQL implementation is basic.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling system.
- **Configuration**: Implemented configuration module with environment-based settings.
- **Data Models**: Implemented all required data models based on the UHI Protocol specification.

**Progress**: 35% complete

## Technical Debt/Issues

1. **Schema Definition**: The database schema needs to be properly defined and migrations created.
2. **Authentication**: Need to implement proper signature verification for the X-Gateway-Authorization header.
3. **Error Handling**: Need to ensure consistent error response format across all endpoints.
4. **Logging**: Enhanced structured logging for improved observability.
5. **In-Memory Storage**: Need to implement the in-memory storage for testing purposes.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the PostgreSQL schema and migrations
2. Complete the implementation of service layer components
3. Implement authentication middleware
4. Create proper handler implementations
5. Add unit tests for core components
6. Set up CI/CD pipelines
